## Everything to Lose
##### *By Pattie Gonia*

Welcome to the planet, my dears.
Wipe your feet. Come on in.
No more need for coats in your mother’s den.

Take a look around.
Take a taste of the waste we found.
This is plastic.
And this is tragic.
And it’s not going away.

So let us sit at the dinner table in the house we call nature.
Come, let’s chat.
I have an icebreaker.

Are we still lighting candles while the house is burning?
While we throw flame and fight over who is right,
Our Mother does not bite her tongue or sit in silence.

Oh no.
Mother Nature’s hella pissed.

You see, a woman knows when she’s been told.
When the men in the boardroom think she’s being too bold.
Too proud, too outspoken,
Too much to handle.
When she’s been made the doormat instead of the mantle.

Is this our message in a plastic bottle?
XO, hugs, kisses. I’ll try harder tomorrow.
Day after day we send our regards.
Millions and millions of plastic discards.

P.S. We don’t give a damn.
But we should really give a damn.

Now I know what you’re saying,
"It’s just a drop in the bucket. It’s just one plastic bag, one straw, so suck it."
Well, suck on this.

Right now, there are more plastic pieces in the ocean than stars in the Milky Way.
A billion plastic bags being used every single day.

While we dress this mess in political gains,
In power change and profits made, 
Our Mother says to go upstairs and put on something new.
So come out of the closet and put on your boots.
We’ve got a shit ton of work to do.

"Dear Mother Nature, I love you
May we do better,
To step up and take care of you.
To save and protect your beautiful sky."

"You’ve been there to listen when I’ve struggled through my darkest days.
Loving you has taught me how to love myself.
Give us a chance to show our gratitude.
You are beautiful, you are loved. We will protect you."

So Queens, let me be straight.
Father Time is ticking on,
And what will be left is what we have done.
And what will be left,
Is what we have done.

Our mother is dying while we are out living.
We must turn the tide from taking to giving.
We will make a difference if we dare to choose.
It’s time that we act.
We’ve got everything to lose.


### Here is some code from one of my previous websites:
```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("look ma’, no spaces");
}
```
